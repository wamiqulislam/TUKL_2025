## Active Learning

I implemented active learning for crop classification using satellite time-series imagery. A CNN-based model was trained to classify crop types using only a **small fraction of labeled data**, reducing annotation cost.

ðŸ“Œ **Key Highlights**:
- Dataset: 20,000 satellite time-series samples
- Task: Multiclass crop classification (3 classes)
- Model: 1D CNN + Fully Connected classifier
- Input: Temporal sensor data (e.g., NDVI over time)
- Strategy: **Margin Sampling** (uncertainty-based)

ðŸŽ¯ **Results**:
Using only **2.5% of the data** (500 labeled samples), the model achieved:

> âœ… **Accuracy: 86.4%**

This demonstrates the power of active learning to minimize labeling effort while maintaining high accuracy.
