## Active Learning

I implemented active learning on satellite imagery time series data for crop classification. I applied active learning methods to train a CNN-based classification model that predicts crop classes using only a small fraction of the available data.

Using **margin sampling**, I was able to achieve **86.4% accuracy** using just **2.5% of the data** (500 out of 20,000 samples). This shows that the model can perform well even with very limited labeled data.
